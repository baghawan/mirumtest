All compiled files are inside the "app" folder, you can open them in browser.
Or you can run development mode by running `gulp` tasks with following steps:

1. Clone this project
2. Run `npm install` on terminal. This command will download all required "node_modules".
3. Run `gulp clean` to remove all files inside "app" folder and replace them with newer files from "src" folder.
4. Run `gulp watch`.
5. Project ready.
